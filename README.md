# token_auth_project
 Project Summary: This Django web application demonstrates a custom implementation of token-based authentication using access and refresh tokens. Users can register, log in, post text content, and view all posts on a homepage. The app manually handles token generation, validation, and invalidation without relying on Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication or third-party libraries. It features a clean, modern design with CSS styling and serves as a student project to showcase backend development and authentication concepts.  Key Features:  Custom token-based authentication (access tokens: 5-minute expiry; refresh tokens: 7-day expiry). User registration and login with hashed passwords. Post submission and display for authenticated users. Logout functionality with token invalidation. Styled with CSS for a user-friendly interface.
